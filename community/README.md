# GraalVM

GraalVM is a universal virtual machine for running applications written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, JVM-based languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, and LLVM-based languages such as C and C++.

Ruby, R and Python language components are optionally available using GraalVM gu utility.

Further details can be found on [www.graalvm.org](https://www.graalvm.org).


# How to use these images

The images are intended for use in the **FROM** field of a downstream Dockerfile. For example, specify `FROM ghcr.io/graalvm/graalvm-ce:latest` or a version tag.

# Building the images

For building a GraalVM Java 8 image use:

```
docker build --build-arg GRAALVM_VERSION=<GraalVM Version> --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java8 -t ghcr.io/graalvm/graalvm-ce:<GraalVM Version>-java8 .
```

For building GraalVM Java 11 or Java 17 amd64 and arm64 images use:

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg GRAALVM_VERSION=<GraalVM Version> --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java11 -t ghcr.io/graalvm/graalvm-ce:<GraalVM Version>-java11-amd64 --output=type=docker -f Dockerfile.java11 .
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 --build-arg GRAALVM_VERSION=<GraalVM Version> --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=java11 -t ghcr.io/graalvm/graalvm-ce:<GraalVM Version>-java11-arm64 --output=type=docker -f Dockerfile.java11 .
```
